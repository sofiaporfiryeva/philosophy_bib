# Bibliographic Reference Analysis for a Philosophy Journal

In this project, I explore the versatile [bib2df](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bib2df/vignettes/bib2df.html) package to analyze bibliographic references for a philosophy journal.

From a dataset of 10,203 entries in BibTeX format, I extract key insights and patterns that underpin philosophical research. Although I work with a .bib file, this approach applies to analyzing Zotero bibliographies as well (see an excellent example [here](https://marionlouveaux.fr/blog/bibliography-analysis/)).
